					From the line chart representing the number of questions as as well as the number of answered questions, we can infer that more questions are often left unanswered over the years. Thus we can conclude that the rate that which questions are being solved is at decreasing rate.
				</p>

				<p>
					The chart also displays a regression line using Chart Studio so we can make a prediction of what’s happening at the end of last year (2017). We are able to determine from this that the rate of which questions are answered is not likely to increase.

					Both, scatter and box plots, were used for this scenarios to determine if higher score insists that the posts got more views. I used a sample of 10,000 posts from last year (2017)
				</p>
				<p>
					From the scatter plot, although it was difficult to infer a proper correlation between the two variables, it could still be easily concluded that a post with higher number of views typically had a positive score rather than a negative. It makes sense in reality since we can ask ourselves - “Why would anybody click on a badly scored post if they were looking for quality answers”.

					This one was a wild card topic that I wanted to solve in hopes of knowing if there is a correlation between the number of answers and the favorites on the post. Also uses a 10k sample size like the previous question.
				</p>
				<p>
					From visualizing the bar chart, we cannot derive a solid correlation between the two in a manner where we want to predict the number of favorites given the answers. In reality, users on the Stackoverflow website look for quality answers and effective reasoning behind answers that other users are entering.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though, there seems to be a “sweet spot” of some sort suggesting that 6 answers to a post will generally yield a higher favorite count. My assumption is that 6 answers to a particular post is a good amount that users will want to read and comprehend from. Anything past this number will drive away the users as a quick and easy answer is what is usually needed by the masses, thus decreasing the quality of the post entirely.
